A recipe webpage is a simple HTML page that showcases various recipes by organizing them into clearly defined sections using HTML elements. The page typically starts with a title in the <head> section and a structured layout in the <body> section. Each recipe is separated into distinct sections, such as:

1. A recipe title using h2 tags
2. A brief description of the dish using <p> tags.
3.  A list of ingredients displayed with <ul> tags.
4. Step-by-step instructions using <ol> tags.
